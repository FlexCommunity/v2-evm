# Flex Perpetuals üêâüî•
Flex Perpetuals is a cutting-edge, pool-based perpetual DEX protocol designed to offer a range of advanced trading features. It provides multi-asset collateral support and cross-margin flexibility, giving traders greater control and efficiency in managing their positions.

To ensure a balanced and sustainable ecosystem, the protocol integrates protective mechanisms such as virtual price impact and funding fees, which help safeguard liquidity providers (LPs) from excessive directional risk. These features create a more resilient trading environment, aligning incentives for both traders and liquidity providers.

## Architecture
`v2-evm` uses handler-service-storage pattern, this pattern ensures a clear separation of concerns and promotes modularity.

Handlers serve as entry points to the protocol, allowing for interaction with EOA or contracts. They facilitate the flow of data and call between internal protocol and outside world.

Services form the core business logic of the protocol. They handle the processing and execution of various operations, such as trading, liquidating, adding or removing liquidity.

Storages are responsible for storing critical states and data of the protocol.
